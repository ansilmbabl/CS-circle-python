# Coding Exercise: Hailstone
The hailstone sequence starting at a positive integer `n` is generated by following two simple rules. If `n` is even, the next number in the sequence is `n/2`. If `n` is odd, the next number in the sequence is `3*n+1`. Repeating this process, we generate the hailstone sequence. Write a recursive function `hailstone(n)` which prints the hailstone sequence beginning at `n`. Stop when the sequence reaches the number `1` (since otherwise, we would loop forever 1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, ...)
<br>For example, when `n=5`, your program should output the following sequence:

    5
    16
    8
    4
    2
    1

def hailstone(n):
   print(n)
   if n==1:
      return 1
   if n%2==0:
      return hailstone(n//2)
   else:
      return hailstone(3*n+1)
