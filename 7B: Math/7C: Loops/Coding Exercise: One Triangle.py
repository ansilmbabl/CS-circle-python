Coding Exercise: One Triangle

Modify the previous program in two ways. First, instead of a square, make it draw a triangle shaped like this: â—¤. 
Second, instead of always having 5 lines, it should take the desired size as input from input(). 
For example, if the input is 3, then the output should be

111
11
1

n=int(input())

for i in range(0,n):
   x=0
   for j in range(i,n):
      x=(x*10)+1

   print(x)
