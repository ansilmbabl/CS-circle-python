# Coding Exercise: Go to it!
Define a function `findLine(prog, target)` to perform the following. Assume prog is a list of strings containing a `BASIC` program, like the type generated by `getBASIC()`; assume target is a string containing a line number, which is the target of a `GOTO` statement. The function should return the index `i` (a number between `0` and `len(prog)-1`) such that `prog[i]` is the line whose label equals target.

Sample input/output: If you call

        findLine(['10 GOTO 20','20 END'], '10')
then the output should be 0, since item 0 of the list is the line with label 10.

## Answer
```python
def findLine(prog, target):
        for i in prog:
                if i.startswith(target):
                        return prog.index(i)
