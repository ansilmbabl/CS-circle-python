Coding Exercise: The Great Escape

Write a program that prints the following:
A double-quote's escaped using a backslash, e.g. \"
Note: there is more than one way to do this (as usual)! For example, you could enclose the whole string in single quotes, or in double quotes. 
In either case, escaping is needed. For extra practice, solve the problem one way, and then solve it the other way. Can you solve it a third way?
