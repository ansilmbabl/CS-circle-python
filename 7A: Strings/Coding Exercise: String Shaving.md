# Coding Exercise: String Shaving
Write a program which reads a string using `input()`, and outputs the same string but with the first and last character deleted. 
(You may assume the input string has length at least 2.) For example, on input `Fairy` a correct program will print `air`.

## Answer
```python
n = input()
print(n[1:len(n)-1])
