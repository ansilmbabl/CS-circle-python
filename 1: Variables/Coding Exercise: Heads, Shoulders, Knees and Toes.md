# Coding Exercise: Heads, Shoulders, Knees and Toes

Write a code fragment (a short part of a Python program) to count heads, shoulders, knees, and toes at a party. 
The grader will automatically define a variable `people` for you, counting the number of people at the party. 
Your code must define four variables, one called `heads`, one called `shoulders`, one called `knees`, and one called `toes`, equal to the number of heads, 
shoulders, knees, and toes in total at the party. Your program does not need to print any output. 
*The grader will select a new random value for `people` each time your code runs.*
